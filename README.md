# 🧠 Machine Learning Classification Projects: KNN, SVM & Naive Bayes

This repository contains two machine learning classification projects implemented using Python. Each project explores a real-world dataset and applies classification techniques such as **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Naive Bayes**.

## 📁 Project Notebooks

### 👨‍🦱 1. Gender Classification
- **Dataset Sample:**
  - Features: `long_hair`, `forehead_width_cm`, `forehead_height_cm`, `nose_wide`, `nose_long`, `lips_thin`, `distance_nose_to_lip_long`
  - Target: `gender`
- **Description:**
  This project uses facial features to classify gender using KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes classifiers. The workflow includes:
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Model Training and Evaluation
  - Accuracy Comparison of Models

### 🏖️ 2. Mountains vs. Beaches Preference Prediction
- **Dataset Sample:**
  - Features: `Age`, `Gender`, `Income`, `Education_Level`, `Travel_Frequency`, `Preferred_Activities`, `Vacation_Budget`, `Location`, `Proximity_to_Mountains`, `Proximity_to_Beaches`, `Favorite_Season`, `Pets`, `Environmental_Concerns`
  - Target: `Preference` (1 = Mountains, 0 = Beaches)
- **Description:**
  This model predicts whether a person prefers mountain or beach vacations based on demographics and travel habits. Steps include:
  - Data Cleaning and Label Encoding
  - Model Building with KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes
  - Performance Comparison
